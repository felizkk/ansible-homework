# Due to unfamiliarity with Amazon Tower API, and due to the fact if The
# OpenTLC CloudForms service is destroyed I have to wait for another 20 minutes
# Plus finding new GUID and writing new private key (GUIDkey .pem) on Tower,
# For this homework destroying AWS instance is limited to resetting the
# RHEL packages
# So it is different with the QA Openstack where the whole server instances
# is deleted and rebuilt later on
# Besides, this is Production! Nobody is supposed to delete production Servers
