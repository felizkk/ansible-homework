# Production Environment - Cleanup all AWS server packages

# Due to unfamiliarity with Amazon Tower API, and due to the fact if The
# OpenTLC CloudForms service is destroyed I have to wait for another 20 minutes
# plus finding new GUID and writing new private key (GUIDkey.pem) on Tower, for
# this homework destroying AWS instance will be limited to resetting/removing the
# RHEL packages + configs. So it is different with the QA Openstack where the
# whole server instances are deleted and rebuilt later on.
# Besides, this is Production! Nobody is supposed to delete production Servers
